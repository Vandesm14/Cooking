# Cooking

A new way to look at cooking, baking, and the related arts.

## Proposal

Recipes are like functions. They take in ingredients as inputs, apply sequential steps to them, then return a new ingredient.

### Rules

1. Ingredients are primitives.
2. Ingredients are static.
3. Recipes can take in one or more ingredients and/or recipes.
4. Recipes evaluate to a single ingredient.
5. Recipes apply steps to all ingredients.
6. Steps must be ordered.
7. Steps can be repeated.
